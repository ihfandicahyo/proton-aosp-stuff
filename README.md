# ProtonAOSP Stuff

Inter was chosen as the UI font for its cleanliness and legibility; it is neutral and looks similar to Apple's San Francisco UI font. Because it was specifically designed for use in GUIs, it is a great replacement for Roboto on Android.

Source Serif was chosen as the serif font because it is one of the best open-source fonts that complement Inter's style.

All fonts included in this repo are open-source and licensed under the [SIL Open Font License.](https://openfontlicense.org/)

- [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) for most text [(4.1).](https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases/tag/v4.1)
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) for monospace text [(6.2).](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/tag/6.2)
- [Source Serif](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif) for serif text [(4.005).](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-serif/releases/tag/4.005R)

## Compatibility

To maximize compatibility, all font names have been patched to match the original fonts. This fixes some issues in third-party apps, such as Firefox.

Additionally, Roboto will be used as a fallback for characters not supported by Inter. This way, unsupported characters are still displayed with the correct metrics and hints.

Since the Pixel stock uses Google Sans for UI and Google apps, and this implementation is a bit hard-coded and doesn't use auto-adjustment in some cases, I had to manually set the most eye-pleasing font metrics for certain styles (see [font_fallback.xml](./font_fallback.xml#L87)). You can change them to your liking by changing the values where they're set.

Compatible and tested with stock Pixel OS based on Android 15 QPR1 (AP4A.250205.002).
